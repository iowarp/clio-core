# Chimaera Configuration for Distributed Testing
# This configuration is used by the distributed unit test Docker cluster

# Memory segment configuration
memory:
  main_segment_size: auto            # Auto-calculated from queue_depth and num_threads
  client_data_segment_size: 2147483648 # 2GB

# Network configuration
networking:
  port: 5555
  neighborhood_size: 4  # Stress test with small neighborhood size for range/broadcast queries
  hostfile: "/workspace/context-runtime/test/integration/distributed/hostfile"

# Logging configuration
logging:
  level: "info"
  file: "/tmp/chimaera.log"

# Runtime configuration (includes worker threads, scheduling, and performance parameters)
runtime:
  # Worker thread configuration
  num_threads: 8             # Worker threads for task execution (4 sched + 4 slow = 8)
  process_reaper_threads: 1  # Process reaper threads

  # Task execution configuration
  queue_depth: 1024          # Task queue depth per worker
  local_sched: "default"     # Local task scheduler
  heartbeat_interval: 1000   # Heartbeat interval in milliseconds

  # Worker sleep configuration (all values in microseconds)
  first_busy_wait: 50        # Busy wait before sleeping when idle (50us)
  max_sleep: 50000           # Maximum sleep duration (50ms)
